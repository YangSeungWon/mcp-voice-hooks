# Design Session 01

You said:
“Is there a good way to do speech recognition in the browser? Like, I want to listen to an audio stream from the user. I want to transcribe it in more or less real time. It doesn't have to be super fast, but I kind of want to transcribe it as we go. And then I want to use an LLM to decide whether the utterance is finished or not, or whether we should keep listening. And then once each utterance is finished, I want to kind of put it into a queue, just the text. We'll talk about what the rest of the pipeline does after, but I was thinking of doing this either in Python, like on the desktop, but I think it'd be nice to do it in the browser if possible.”

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely! Doing this in the browser is definitely possible and can be pretty convenient since you can just use JavaScript and not worry about backend infrastructure. The Web Speech API is a good starting point for that. It allows you to do speech recognition right in the browser, and it supports continuous transcription, which means you can keep listening and transcribing as the user speaks.

You can then easily feed that transcribed text into an LLM running either in the browser or on a backend. This way, you can have the LLM determine when the user has finished speaking or if it should keep listening. Once the utterance is complete, you can just put the text into a queue for the next step of your pipeline. It’s a neat and pretty efficient way to handle things!

You said:
“Is the WebSpeech API, is it pretty accurate? I know that Whisper is like pretty, like, state of the art in terms of something that you could run locally, but it's kind of heavy, it's, you know, it would take a lot of memory and we can't download that into the browser, obviously.”
00:18

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, the Web Speech API is pretty decent for general use, but it might not be as accurate as something like Whisper, which is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle different accents and noisy environments. The Web Speech API uses whatever speech recognition service is provided by the browser, and that can vary. For example, Chrome uses Google’s speech recognition, which is quite good but still may not match the accuracy of Whisper.

So it really depends on your needs. If you need state-of-the-art accuracy, Whisper might be a better choice, but you might have to run it on a server and then send the audio to that server for processing. It’s a trade-off between convenience and accuracy.

You said:
“So do the browsers each provide their own speech recognition model?”
00:04

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that's pretty much how it works! Each browser tends to use its own underlying speech recognition service. For example, Chrome relies on Google's speech recognition, which is pretty robust. Other browsers might use different services. For instance,

ChatGPT said:
That's right, the speech recognition is typically done in the cloud rather than locally, so the browser sends the audio to the service provider's servers, and then the transcription is sent back to the browser. This approach helps keep the performance smooth and avoids the need for heavy processing on the user's device. It does mean you need an internet connection, of course, but it

You said:
“What does it do on Safari?”
00:01

ChatGPT said:
Safari actually uses Apple's speech recognition service, which is built into their ecosystem. So if you're using Safari, your audio gets processed by Apple's servers, and then the transcription is returned to the browser. It's a similar approach to what Chrome does with Google's service, just using Apple's technology instead.

You said:
“How about Firefox?”
00:01

ChatGPT said:
Firefox, on the other hand, doesn't have a built-in speech recognition service of its own, and it doesn't natively support the Web Speech API for speech recognition the way Chrome or Safari does. So if you want to do speech recognition

You said:
“Well, how about Edge, then, Microsoft Edge?”
00:02

ChatGPT said:
Microsoft Edge actually uses the same underlying technology as Chrome, since it's based on Chromium. That means Edge also uses Google's speech recognition service to handle transcription. So you'll get a pretty similar experience

You said:
“Well, that's free to use.”
00:01

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, for the most part, it is free to use. The Web Speech API doesn't require any separate subscription or payment, and it's just part of the browser. So as long as you're using a browser that supports it, you can

You said:
“What's the privacy policy on that?”
00:02

ChatGPT said:
That's a great question! Since the speech recognition is done in the cloud, the audio does get sent to the service provider's servers. Both Google and Apple have privacy policies in place that cover how they handle data, but generally, they say that the audio is used to improve their services and is typically not stored long-term or linked back to your identity. But it's always a good idea to check the specific privacy policies of the service you're using, just to be sure you're comfortable with how your data is handled.

You said:
“For development, I could start with that, and then I could move to something more custom, more privacy-focused after I have my proof-of-concept working.”
00:08

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that sounds like a solid plan! Starting with the Web Speech API is a great way to get things up and running quickly and easily, and then once you have everything working, you can always transition to a more custom solution that gives you more control over privacy and data handling. It's always good to get that proof of concept done first and then refine from there.

You said:
“I have a design for something that I've been thinking about using. Can you read it right now?”
00:05

ChatGPT said:
I can't see anything on your end unless you share it with me directly. If you have a design or a document, you can describe it to me or upload it if you'd like, and I'd be happy to help out with any feedback or thoughts!

You said:
“I think you can see it now.”
00:01

ChatGPT said:
Got it! Your design sounds really interesting and quite dynamic. Essentially, you're creating a system that continuously listens for microphone input and uses a language model to determine when a complete thought or utterance is finished. Once it decides that the user has completed a thought, it queues that text up for further processing or feedback. And I love the idea of having hooks, like integrating with Claude or other tools, so that the system can get real-time feedback. That way, if the user wants to interrupt or give a command like "Stop" or "Wait," the system can immediately respond and adjust what it's doing. And it sounds like you're also thinking about different modes, like a listen-only mode or a speak-only mode, which can add a lot of flexibility to how the system interacts with users. Overall, it looks like a really neat concept, and it seems like it could be quite user-friendly once it's all put together!

You said:
“So the main thing I'm thinking of right now is if I was to build this MCP server, would it make more sense to do it in Python or TypeScript? So I think what I could imagine doing with TypeScript, the main thing that I need is an input selector or something or at least some sort of feedback. I've used MCP servers that have no UI before and they're kind of annoying. Maybe I could just make a debug UI. That's maybe something we could consider. I would like to use just the default audio input as much as possible, just have the user pick their own mic input on their Mac. But anyway, so I guess it doesn't really matter. But Python seems a little bit heavier than doing it just with TypeScript.”
00:52

ChatGPT said:
Both Python and TypeScript have their strengths, so it really depends on what you're aiming for. If you're leaning towards building something that runs smoothly in the browser, TypeScript is a great choice. It integrates well with web technologies, and you can easily build a user interface to select

You said:
“Well, so it's like the, uh, the clients, I think they're called, so I'm going to be running Cloud Code as the main client, but potentially, like, later I could use others like, uh, Cursor or Goose or, uh, Cloud Desktop or even, uh, ChatGPT Desktop. Anyway, so these would all be connecting to the server. I don't think it necessarily has to run in the browser.”
00:26

ChatGPT said:
That makes sense! If you're planning to have multiple clients like Claude, Cursor, Goose, or others connecting to the server, then you definitely have flexibility in terms of the tech stack. If you don't need it to run strictly in the browser, Python could be a great option because it's really powerful for

You said:
“I so I think I have option one is like just right as I like node server I think would be called which has no browser at all but then I don't know how we would do the speech recognition I think it might be useful to have the browser pop open when you start running this so that you can monitor your audio input and we could use the speech API but maybe that's not necessary maybe we could use a speech API from a node server I don't know too much about TypeScript”
01:00

ChatGPT said:
If you're leaning towards a Node server, you can definitely still use the browser for the speech recognition part by having it open up and handle the audio input and then send that transcription back to your Node server. That way, you get the best of both worlds: you can rely on the browser's built-in Web Speech API for convenience and then use Node on the backend for more complex logic or integration with other tools. It's definitely a flexible approach, and you can always start with one method and adjust as you go along.

You said:
“Could we capture audio directly from a node server?”
00:02

ChatGPT said:
Capturing audio directly from a Node server is possible, but it does require a bit of setup. Typically, Node itself doesn't directly interact with hardware like microphones, so you'd need to use something like a native module or an external library that can interface with the operating system to capture audio. One common approach is to run a small local client application that captures the audio and then streams it to the Node server for processing. So it's definitely doable, but it might be a bit more complex compared to just using the browser's built-in capabilities.

You said:
“So in your opinion, is the browser the simplest way to get started with this?”
00:05

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I think starting with the browser is definitely the simplest way to get going.

You said:
“Are you aware of the, um, are you aware of the, um, like, I guess, the architecture of an MCP? Do we... Like I said, I don't know a lot about TypeScript or what have you, so I assume you would start it kind of from the command line and it would probably create like a local server and then hopefully we could automatically pop open the browser to show the interface and in the browser that would be like a client talking to the server and it would run client code which does the audio capture and the transcription and then it would send the transcriptions to the server but all that would be in like a single repo I think, right? Like we just write kind of one app that starts a server and launches the browser. Does that make sense?”
01:28

ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that absolutely makes sense, and it's a pretty common architecture for something like this. You'd essentially have a single application that, when you start it from the command line, spins up a local server. That server can then automatically open a browser window to provide the user interface, and that browser client would handle capturing audio, performing transcription, and sending the results back to the server. This way, everything is nicely integrated in one app, and you get a smooth workflow between the client and the server. It definitely sounds like a solid approach!

You said:
“And you think that's more straightforward than just having the server try to capture the audio directly?”
00:05

ChatGPT said:
In many cases, having the browser handle the audio capture is more straightforward, especially because the browser already has built-in support for accessing the microphone and using the Web Speech API. This means you don't have to worry about the complexities of handling audio input at the operating system level in your Node server. It simplifies the development process and leverages the browser's capabilities, making it a bit easier to get everything up and running smoothly.

You said:
“Okay, and I'm thinking about the text-to-speech side now, so the Mac has a built-in say command that we could leverage. Can the node server call that say command like a bash?”
00:13

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Your Node server can definitely call the Mac's built-in say command. You can use Node's child_process module to execute shell commands, including say. This way, your server can trigger text-to-speech output directly on the user's machine. It's a pretty handy way to handle TTS if you're running everything locally on a Mac.
