# Speech MCP with hooks

We start the server, which probably opens a browser or something to get mic input. It listens for mic input continuously and it categorizes input as complete utterances. Using an LLM, so it transcribes the audio as it comes in and then once it detects that the user has finished a thought, then it cues it up as an utterance. And we put a hook in for clod so that every time it runs a tool or finishes doing something, it checks for any utterances so that it can get feedback quickly on what it's doing. So you can just say something as it doesn't edit and you can say like "No, stop" or "Wait, that's not what I meant." And it could get those utterances as it goes. That would allow it to continue running pretty continuously. And it can use a command to say back if you want it to speak, but you could have it in listen-only mode. Then you could also have a speak-only mode where you have post hooks where it's describing what it's doing the whole time. Or pre-hooks. Probably pre-hooks. I'm not sure. Both could be useful, I guess.

The catch is when it finishes, if it actually asks for text input. Yeah, it shouldn't. Basically, before stopping, it should go into a listening mode, which should have a really long timeout. It should say, like, "I'm done. What do you want me to do next?" And then it should call a Listen MCP tool, rather than just a Get Recent Utterances. Yeah, basically, if it finishes and there are no... When it finishes, it should say, it should check for the most recent utterances. If there's nothing, then it should speak something. And finally, it should listen for more instructions. So it should actually never stop as long as you say something within the MCP timeout.
