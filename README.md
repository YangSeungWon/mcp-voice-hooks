# mcp-voice-hooks

Real-time voice interaction for Claude Code. Speak naturally while Claude works - interrupt, redirect, or provide continuous feedback without stopping.

## Demo

## Overview

mcp-voice-hooks enables continuous voice conversations with AI assistants by:

- Capturing voice input in real-time through a web interface
- Queuing utterances for processing by Claude Code
- Using hooks to ensure Claude checks for voice input before tool use and before stopping
- Allowing natural interruptions like "No, stop that" or "Wait, try something else"

## Features

- üé§ **Real-time Voice Capture**: Browser-based speech recognition with automatic segmentation
- üîÑ **Continuous Interaction**: Keep talking while Claude works - no need to stop between commands
- ü™ù **Smart Hook System**: Pre-tool and stop hooks ensure Claude always checks for your input

## Installation in Your Own Project

1. **Add the MCP server**:

   Run the following command to automatically add the MCP server to your current project in `~/.claude.json`:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add voice-hooks npx mcp-voice-hooks
    ```

   or manually add the following to your project's `.mcp.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "voice-hooks": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-voice-hooks"],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code**:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Open the voice interface** at <http://localhost:5111> and start speaking!

   The hooks are automatically installed when the MCP server starts. You need to send one text message to Claude to trigger the voice hooks.

   **Note**: After the first-time installation, you may need to restart Claude for the hooks to take effect.

   The default port is 5111. To use a different port, add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "MCP_VOICE_HOOKS_PORT": "8080"
     }
   }
   ```

## Voice responses

Voice responses are disabled by default. To enable them:

1. Open the web interface at <http://localhost:5111>
2. Check the "Enable Voice Responses" checkbox
3. Optionally check "Use Browser TTS" for cross-platform text-to-speech

No configuration files or environment variables needed! The settings are saved in your browser and applied immediately.

### Browser Text-to-Speech (Cross-platform)

When "Use Browser TTS" is enabled:
- Voice selection dropdown appears
- Adjustable speech rate slider
- Test button to preview your selected voice
- Works on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)

### System Voice (Mac only)

When "Use Browser TTS" is unchecked, the system uses macOS's built-in `say` command.

Configure the system voice in `System Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > System Voice`

I recommend using a Siri voice, as they are much higher quality.

Click the info icon next to the system voice dropdown. Search for "Siri" to find the highest quality voices. You'll have to trigger a download of the voice.

It may take a while to download.

Once it's downloaded, you can select it in the system voice dropdown.

Test it with the bash command:

```bash
say "Hi, this is your mac system voice"
```


## Manual Hook Installation

The hooks are automatically installed/updated when the MCP server starts. However, if you need to manually install or reconfigure the hooks:

```bash
npx mcp-voice-hooks install-hooks
```

This will:

- Clean up any existing `~/.mcp-voice-hooks` directory contents
- Install/update hook scripts to `~/.mcp-voice-hooks/hooks/`
- Configure your project's `.claude/settings.json`

## Uninstallation

To completely remove MCP Voice Hooks:

```bash
# Remove hooks and settings
npx mcp-voice-hooks uninstall

# Also remove from Claude MCP servers
claude mcp remove voice-hooks
```

This will:

- Remove the `~/.mcp-voice-hooks` directory
- Clean up voice hooks from your project's `.claude/settings.json`
- Preserve any custom hooks you've added

## Known Limitations

- **Intermittent Stop Hook Execution**: Claude Code's Stop hooks are not triggered consistently. Sometimes the assistant can end responses without the Stop hook being executed. I believe this is an issue with Claude Code's hook system, not with mcp-voice-hooks. When working correctly, the Stop hook should prevent the assistant from stopping without first checking for voice input.

## Development Mode

If you're developing mcp-voice-hooks itself:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/johnmatthewtennant/mcp-voice-hooks.git
cd mcp-voice-hooks

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Link the package locally
npm link

# 4. Install hooks (one time)
npx mcp-voice-hooks install-hooks

# 5. Start Claude Code
claude
```

**Important**: When developing with `npm link`:

- Claude runs the compiled JavaScript from the `dist` folder, not your TypeScript source
- After making changes to **TypeScript files** (`src/*.ts`), you must run `npm run build`
- For changes to **browser files** (`public/*`), just restart Claude Code
- Then restart Claude Code to use the updated code

### Hot Reload

For hot reload during development, you can run the development server with

```bash
npm run dev-unified
```

and then configure claude to use the mcp proxy like so:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voice-hooks": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-proxy"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
